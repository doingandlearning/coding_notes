#Reopening the box model

I'd played with the box model before so this was a refresher.
Really enjoyed the challenge of making a lemon with just borders.
Still working on getting VIM to work for my needs but definitely my editor of choice.

Looking a bit more at display properties - including block, inline, inline-block and none.
display:none can make something disappear - JS 
Mixture of block and inline-block for menu layouts
Make sure you add in margins and padding when thinking about element width and height
